    "In this lab, you will work in teams to use your Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) implementation from Lab 4 in practice. We have set up obstacles in the drone cage in G105. You will measure the positions of the obstacles, field, and starting/end locations, and use the RRT code to find a  trajectory through the space. We provide you the code to run the drone through a sequence of setpoints (in x,y) provided to it. You will be graded on your ability to autonomously navigate the drone from the starting position to the end goal location. \n",
